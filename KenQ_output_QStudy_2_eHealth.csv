1,1The functionalities of this hearing aid app are not accessible without knowing my location.
2,2The new dashboard of this health app has taken a lot of fun out of the experience. It's terrible and consists of dull circles and colours. It's boring.
3,"3I've spent most of the day trying to print out my daughter's immunisation record generated by the app, but to no avail. It's very frustrating."
4,4This food diary app is trying to force me to go premium. I would rather stick with my physical food diary; at least my pen and paper are reliable and won't crash.
5,"5This ehealth app sold my data to ambulance chasers, so I requested my account be deleted. Nine months later my account is still active. They lied to me."
6,6Now I get rude marketers calling after installing this health app. You don't care who uses your services which in turn tarnishes your product. I won't refer you.
7,7I'm forced to use this health app to make an online claim. I'm required to take a picture of the receipt through the app even though the app quality is terrible.
8,"8This healthy food app only caters for folks in the USA, as it only uses the imperial system. Customers from other countries find it difficult to use."
9,"9Before I used this ehealth app, fear of pain never entered my mind. Now I have to worry about extra fear and anxiety that wasn't there before."
10,10This eHealth app shows numerous defibrillator locations but many are not available for public use. This misleading information could lead to a loss of life.
