The elicitation of end-users human values – such as freedom, honesty, transparency – is important in the development of software systems.

In this project, we carried out two preliminary Q-studies to understand:

the general human value opinion types of eHealth app end users
the eHealth domain human value opinion types of eHealth app end users
whether there are differences between the general and eHealth domain opinion types.
Our initial results revealed three value opinion types using generic value instruments:

fun-loving, success-driven and independent end user
security-conscious, socially concerned and success-driven end user
benevolent, success-driven and conformist end user
We also identified two value opinion types using domain-specific value instruments: security-conscious, reputable and honest end-user, and success-driven, reputable and pain-avoiding end user.

Given these results, consideration should be given to domain context in the design and application of values elicitation instruments.
